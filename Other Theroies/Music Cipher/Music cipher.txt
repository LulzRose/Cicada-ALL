This is something extraordinary going on here. Bach wrote simple coronation ciphers. Sir Edward Elgar wrote somewhat more complicated messages. This is like liquid math, and it's going to take me some time to sort it out, but so far, he is hitting his sounding cards on primes,notably the 5ths, and creating a fib sequence in the upper registers( Treble clef). Then there is merging on the 5th notes that meet at 3rd and 7ths. Then he runs his melody line down from treble to bass and hits all fifths and thirds!. This is flipping awesome from a mathematical point of view. How he can all make it fit into a cohesive melody is crazy crazy crazy.?
